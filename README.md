# lfg-gameboard

## Description

This is a web app that allows users to find other people to play online games with. They can search by game and use a forum interface to post and comment on other posts to get in touch with other people to complete multiplayer content.

## Table of Contents (Optional)


## Installation

You should be able to simply use the app from the deployed heroku link below. If you are using the REPO, you will need to use npm - i to install dependencies and you will need to sign in to mysql in the command line, run SOURCE db/schema.sql to set up the database, then run node seeds/index.js to fill in the tables. Afterwards app should function normally when run through node server.js. (Also be sure to set up .env file with mysql user and password, and secret).

## Usage

To use the app, you can visit the [deployed heroku link](https://guarded-headland-70265.herokuapp.com/). You can on the website sign in so that you can view other forum posts for a given game, and make comments. 

The original REPO can be accessed [here](https://github.com/RWWoods/lfg-gameboard).
